## Design Principles That Guide Us

### 1. Developer First
Every decision optimizes for developer experience and productivity.

### 2. Quality Built In
Quality isn't checked after - it's guaranteed during.

### 3. Collective Intelligence
The system gets smarter with every use by everyone.

### 4. Open Innovation
The best ideas come from the community.

### 5. Measurable Impact
If we can't measure the improvement, we haven't improved.

## What We're NOT Building

- Not a chatbot with better prompts
- Not a code generator that needs constant correction
- Not a tool that requires extensive configuration
- Not a closed system controlled by one company

## How We Make Decisions

All major decisions are:
1. Discussed in GitHub Issues
2. Aligned with this north star
3. Backed by data or clear reasoning
4. Open to community input
5. Documented in design-decisions.md

## Success Indicators

We'll know we've succeeded when:
- Developers can't imagine working without agents
- "Agent-assisted" becomes the default way to code
- Junior developers are as productive as seniors
- The community is driving innovation faster than we are

## Join the Journey

This vision is bigger than any one person or company. We need:
- Developers to use and feedback
- Contributors to build agents
- Companies to adopt and invest
- Researchers to push boundaries

**The future of software development is collaborative AI, and we're building it together.**

# Modular Agent Architecture for AI Workflows

## Core Concept
Break complex AI interactions into specialized agents that handle specific domains, enabling:
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Deep specialization for quality
- Composable workflows
- Clear separation of concerns

## Agent Types

### 1. Research Agent
- Code exploration and understanding
- Pattern detection
- Dependency analysis
- Documentation search

### 2. Planning Agent
- Task decomposition
- Dependency mapping
- Risk assessment
- Time estimation

### 3. Implementation Agent
- Code generation
- Refactoring
- Test writing
- Performance optimization

### 4. Quality Agent
- Code review
- Security analysis
- Performance profiling
- Best practices enforcement

### 5. Documentation Agent
- API documentation
- README updates
- Architecture diagrams
- Usage examples

### 6. Testing Agent
- Test case generation
- Edge case identification
- Test execution
- Coverage analysis

## Agent Communication Protocol

```yaml
agent_message:
  from: agent_id
  to: agent_id | orchestrator
  type: request | response | event
  payload:
    task: description
    context: relevant_data
    priority: high | medium | low
    constraints: []
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Research
```
User Request -> Orchestrator -> [Research Agent, Documentation Agent]
                             -> Aggregate Results
                             -> Planning Agent
```

### Pattern 2: Implementation Pipeline
```
Planning Agent -> Implementation Agent -> Testing Agent -> Quality Agent
```

### Pattern 3: Continuous Improvement
```
Quality Agent -> Findings -> Implementation Agent
              -> Documentation Agent
              -> Cycle back
```

## Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Add new agents without disrupting existing ones
2. **Quality**: Each agent can be optimized for its specific task
3. **Speed**: Parallel execution of independent tasks
4. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
5. **Flexibility**: Compose different workflows for different needs

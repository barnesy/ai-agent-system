# Current Tasks and Notes

## Active Work
- âœ… AI Agent System MVP complete
- All 6 agents implemented and working
- Real-world workflows demonstrated

## Decisions Made
- Modular agent architecture chosen over monolithic AI
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Message-based communication for loose coupling
- Workflow-first approach for immediate value
- See `design-decisions.md` for detailed rationale

## Questions/Blockers
- How to integrate with actual AI models (Claude API, GPT, etc.)
- State management strategy for production use
- Performance benchmarking methodology
- Community building strategy

## Progress Log
- Created initial project structure
- Set up CLAUDE.md for context
- Created organized directories: notes/, docs/, workspace/
- Implemented all 6 specialized agents
- Built orchestration system
- Created 3 real-world workflows
- Published to GitHub: https://github.com/barnesy/ai-agent-system
- Documented design philosophy and decisions

## Next Phase Ideas
1. **AI Integration Layer**
   - Adapter pattern for multiple AI providers
   - Cost optimization strategies
   - Response caching

2. **Developer Experience**

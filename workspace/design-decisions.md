# Design Decisions Log

## Decision: Modular Agent Architecture
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Context**: Need to achieve "massive innovation in AI collaboration quality"
**Options Considered**:
1. Single super-intelligent AI
2. Multiple specialized agents
3. Hierarchical AI system

**Decision**: Multiple specialized agents
**Rationale**: 
- Specialization leads to expertise
- Parallel execution possible
- Easier to debug and improve individual components
- Mirrors successful human team dynamics

## Decision: Six Core Agents
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Context**: Which agents are essential for development workflows?
**Decision**: Research, Planning, Implementation, Quality, Testing, Documentation
**Rationale**:
- Covers the complete development lifecycle
- Each has distinct responsibilities
- No significant overlap
- Maps to common bottlenecks in development

---

## Decision: Message-Based Communication
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Context**: How should agents communicate?
**Options Considered**:
1. Direct function calls
2. Shared memory/state
3. Message passing

**Decision**: Message passing with structured format
**Rationale**:
- Loose coupling between agents
- Easy to add new agents
- Can be distributed later
- Clear audit trail

---

## Decision: Workflow-First Approach
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Context**: How to make the system useful immediately?
**Decision**: Create pre-built workflows for common tasks
**Rationale**:
- Immediate value to developers
- Shows system capabilities
- Patterns emerge from real use cases
- Easy onboarding

---

## Decision: TypeScript Implementation
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Context**: Implementation language choice
**Options Considered**:
1. Python (AI/ML ecosystem)
2. TypeScript (type safety)
3. Go (performance)

**Decision**: TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Type safety for agent interfaces
- Excellent developer experience
- Easy web integration
- Growing AI/ML support

---

## Decision: GitHub as Source of Truth
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Context**: Where to maintain code and documentation
**Decision**: Everything in GitHub, documentation as code
**Rationale**:
- Version control for all artifacts
- Collaboration friendly
- Issue tracking integrated
- CI/CD ready

---

## Decision: Open Source First
**Date**: 2024-01-26
**Context**: Distribution and development model
**Decision**: MIT license, open development
**Rationale**:
- Community contributions accelerate development
- Transparency builds trust
- Learn from real-world usage
- Commercial offerings can build on top

**Options**:
1. Direct API integration
2. Adapter pattern for multiple providers
3. Local model support

**Considerations**:
- Cost management
- Performance requirements
- Privacy concerns
- Offline capability

### Pending: State Management
**Context**: How to maintain context across agent interactions
**Options**:
1. In-memory for single session
2. Persistent storage
3. Distributed cache

**Considerations**:
- Scalability needs
- Privacy requirements
- Performance impact
- Complexity tradeoff

### Pending: User Interface
**Context**: How developers interact with the system
**Options**:
1. CLI only
2. Web dashboard
3. IDE integration
4. All of the above

**Considerations**:
- Developer preferences
- Maintenance burden
- Feature parity
- User experience
